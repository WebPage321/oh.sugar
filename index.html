  <h2>The reality of our sugar intake</h2>
  <p> Most of us think that cutting out sugar from our diets for a few weeks is the best thing for our bodies. Resisting the urge and exercising our willpower, so that we don’t reach into the fridge for that crunchy chocolate biscuit. 
  <p> So I sat down with my doctor and asked her what the benefits were of removing sugar from my diet for a short period of time, and to my utter surprise, she told me it was the worst thing I could do for my body and energy levels.

<p> I asked Dr. Zandra Quinn, my local GP, some of the questions that have come to my mind when I have read about these sugar-free crazes and here are her eye-opening answers.
<br>
<h2>Dr. Zandra Quinn</h2>

</div>

<p>

  <p> <strong> Q: What effect does sugar have on our bodies? </strong><p>
<p> A: We all need a bit of sugar anyway to give us the energy to perform daily activities. But it’s when we have the 'out of balance', which is when we have too much sugar, that we start to store it in our body as fats. Ultimately if we’re taking to much sugar on a regular basis, we can become obese, which can increase our risk of diabetes.

  "The ideal is to have no added sugar in your diet." - Doctor Zandra Quinn
</blockquote>
<p> <strong> Q: Is having a sugar-free week or fortnight worth it? </strong>
<p> A: No, if anything it confuses the body completely, it upsets your sugar control, so we as doctors do advise that you have a regular low-sugar diet, that’s the best thing to do. If you go without sugar for some weeks, it upsets your balance system in terms of your insulin levels in your pancreas, so just go for a permanent low sugar diet.
<p> <strong>Q: What is the best way to lower our intake of sugar? </strong>
<p> A: The ideal is to have no added sugar in your diet, you will get natural sugars from fruits, which is recommended. There is no reason to add sugar at all, and that’s when it becomes unhealthy. 
<p> <strong>Q: The media have highlighted recently about the amount of sugar in our coffees from leading coffee chains, so with that in mind, what is your advice on the amount of sugar people are consuming without realising? </strong>
<p> A: A lot of people think, ‘I’m having tomato soup, that’s fruit, so that’s healthy’. They think it’s healthy because it’s a soup, but actually tomato soup in particular and beans as well for the same reason, both have a very high sugar content in them. I just wish companies would label foods, so that the general public can understand what is in the food they are eating, and then they’d have a bit more control over what they are eating.

  <h2>The science of sugar
</h2>

<p> There are a lot of facts that I don’t think we, as the general public, are aware of in terms of sugar. In a sentence we need some sugar in our bodies because, it fuels the mitochondria in our cells, it creates energy for our body. 
<p> To get a different perspective on the sugar-free craze, I contacted Deborah Thackeray, a nutritionist from Yorkshire. I asked her the same question, about whether it is worth not eating any added sugar for a short period of time, and received a very scientific answer.
</p>

<h2>Deborah Thackeray</h2>

<p> <strong> Q: Is having a sugar-free week or fortnight worth it? </strong>
<p> A: A week wouldn’t make any difference, your body makes energy preferentially from glucose in the diet, for example carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are found not just in sugary foods, but in grains, potatoes and vegetables, like carrots, but our bodies can also make energy out of fats as well. 
<p> Sugar in the diet will turn into blood sugar which is needed to make energy in our cells. Fats in the diet can be made into blood glucose, but preferentially, your body will always make blood glucose out of glucose in the diet rather than fat. Which is why if you eat sugar and fat together…you get fat.
<br>
<p> <strong> Q: What is your advice on the amount of sugar people are consuming without realising? </strong>
<p> A: You need to read labels really, really carefully and things that are often seen as healthy, for instance, low fat yogurts and pre-made smoothies often have a lot of hidden sugar in them. It’s added sugar that is leading to the rise in, obesity and type 2 diabetes, it’s a massive problem.

<br>
<p>After I spoke to Deborah, I decided to look into the type 2 diabetes figures, because we always hear about the levels of obesity in the UK due to a high sugar diet, but not the other health problems. Diabetes UK conducts a lot of research into the health issue, with some staggering figures (see below).

<h2>Simple steps to lower your sugar intake</h2>

  <p> Fear not, there is a solution to the amount of sugar many of us are consuming knowingly, and unknowingly. Deborah Thackeray gave the best advice on how to tighten our grip on how much sugar we are consuming. 

  </p>

<p> <strong> Q: What is the best way to lower our intake of sugar? </strong>
<p> A: Make your food yourself, avoid ready meals and packaged foods, they always contain a lot of hidden sugars. Eat more veg. 
</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>
  So that’s what I did, I dug out my cooking apron, dusted off my weighing scales and experimented, to see if food tasted as good without all that added sugar. 
  </p>

  <p>Firstly, I made a bright green juice with all the vegetables I don’t particularly like eating in their raw form.

<p>
<center>  Followed by some delicious (if I do say so myself) pitta pizzas… </center>
</p>
<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0-rGms4Etw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p> <center> And some mouth-watering lemon meringue pies… </center>
</p>
<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/54eoYxeHHhg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p> These recipes prove that having less sugar in your diet does not have to be boring and tasteless. Lowering your daily sugar intake by just a few spoonful’s can have a positive effect on your body, energy levels and skin. 
</p>
<p> I took on the challenge and after just over a week, I feel less reliant upon sugary treats, and my energy levels have increased (slightly) and to my joy my skin has less blemishes.
